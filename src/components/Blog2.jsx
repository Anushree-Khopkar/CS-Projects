					Religion or faith have no bar here. You could even be non-religious. Yet, the sanctity of Harmandir Sahib, popularly known as Golden 
					Temple will touch your heart. It is located in the city of Amritsar in one of the northern states of India, Punjab. The long path in 
					the lake is the approach to the main temple. Inspite of round the clock devotees, discipline prevails. The Golden Temple is the most 
					revered gurudwara for the Sikhs. Harmandir Sahib is its official name. But due to its the gold plated building, devotees lovingly refer 
					to it as the Golden Temple. The main building of the Golden Temple is surrounded by a lake. People of all religions come here in huge 
					numbers to offer prayers and take a dip in this supposedly holy lake.
					</p>
					<p>
					We spent an entire day at the Golden temple. Spent hours sitting by the lake on the sparkling clean floor, admiring the beautiful Golden 
					Temple in front. We could just feel the devotion in the air. Both the sunrise and the sunset are glorious in the premises of the 
					Golden Temple. As the sun sets, the Golden Temple is bathed in beautiful yellow and blue lights. You can actually spend the entire 
					night at the Golden Temple. Just get a sleeping mat and lie down on the marble around the holy lake and enjoy a blissful night.The 
					long wait in the queue to get inside the Golden Temple is totally worth it. Have patience as the queue slowly but steadily inches forward. 
					Because The insides have to be seen to be believed. Photography isn’t permitted inside. You have to store in your memory the beauty 
					that accosts you. It is two floors of sheer brilliance.
					</p>

					Food from Punjab is the most well known cuisine across the world. And Amritsar is brimming with “dhabas“. These are small, traditional 
					eateries run by the same family fro generations. We went to one of the oldest such dhabas, named Kesar da Dhaba. It is over a hundred 
					year old establishment in the maze-like markets of old Amritsar is famous for cooking all their food in “desi ghee” (Indian equivalent 
					of butter). Like all things Indian (food), it is rich, tasty and devoid of preservatives. We had a lavish lunch of Dal Makhani, Chole and 
					Paratha in the Punjabi Thali in Amritsar at Keasr da Dhaba. For the non-Indians, that is: Buttered lentil curry, Bengal gram pulses cooked 
					in a spicy curry and layered Indian bread. This single “thali” (meal plate) was more than enough for the two of us. All one should 
					ideally do after eating this is find a beautiful tree, lie down in its shade and dream of the culinary extravaganza you have just 
					experienced.
