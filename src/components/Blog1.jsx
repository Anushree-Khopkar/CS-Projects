						Today was surely the highlight of highlights of sightseeing visits. What could possibly beat a visit to the Magnificent and Magical Taj 
						Mahal. Tickets were purchased at home, online to avoid long ticket queues, but actually we really didn't see any. Interesting to note 
						that we, as foreigners, pay 1000 rupees entrance while it is just 40 rupees for Indians. Perfectly fair. We wandered down the parade walk 
						to the East Gate entrance. Was slightly dumbstruck when I was offered a wheelchair "for the 2 kilometres still to walk" (a Big untruth 
						there, more like 1/4 km). I may be carrying my collapsible stick around but that is for use on the many stairs to be found here, some of 
						which are often nastily and surprisingly deep. I Do Not need a wheelchair. Thanked the wheelchair bearer but No Ta and no doubt I would 
						have ended up paying handsomely for the use of. Lots of tourist stalls along the way and had to fight off the shopkeeper's demands to 
						take a look with empty promises to look on the way back.

						We were of course not alone at the Taj Mahal. There were lots of others there too but it wasn't frantically busy and everyone was good
						humoured. Several times we had to step round groups having their photos taken. It would be impossible to visit this place without being 
						photographed with it in the background. So yes, I have a few of those too. Didn't manage a photo from that famous bench as there were a 
						few people just sitting on it admiring the sights, oblivious to everyone around who wanted to sit on it for a photo with the this so famous 
						monument behind them. The Taj Mahal is closed on Fridays- so don’t go then. We would avoid a Saturday too, if you can. We went on a 
						Saturday and it was beyond busy in the morning. We got there around 2 hours before the opening time and the place had hundreds of people 
						already there before the doors were open. This meant trying to get that perfect shot was a lot more difficult. But, our tuk tuk driver 
						said Monday’s are the quietest day, and we do know people who’ve been to the Taj on sunrise and it’s empty for like an hour, so perfect. 
						This still happens during the week, just not on a Saturday, for obvious reasons.
					</p>
					<p>
						We decided to find a market for the afternoon's entertainment and took a tuk-tuk to Sadar Bazaar. On the way we went through the real 
						backstreets of what the tuk-tuk driver called his village. First impressions were of a medieval scene. More photos taken and everyone 
						seems quite happy to be photographed. The bazaar was not what we wanted at all, a local's shopping area, with individual shops out onto 
						the street and not an enclosed space as I had expected as we have found in Thailand and Vietnam. hen our Tuk-tuk ride descended into the 
						usual confusion which always arises once you step into a tuk-tuk. We gave in and allowed ourselves to be transported up and around a few 
						sales outlets, textiles, leather and finally a carpet shop as tuk-tuk driver said he would get a litre of fuel if we would just go in there.
